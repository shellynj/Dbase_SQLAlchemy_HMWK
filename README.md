### Homework Assignment SQLAlchemy
#### Michelle Boykins


### Objective:
For this homework, you need to create a new branch of your calculator project or you can make a new project. In this branch, you need to follow this tutorial:

https://overiq.com/sqlalchemy-101/crud-using-sqlalchemy-orm/ (Links to an external site.)

You need to make a commit for each completed section.  This tutorial requires you to follow previous hands on tutorials to get sqlAlchemy to work with sqlite instead of the Postgres connection used with the project.  

You need to submit a direct link to your branch on Github.
